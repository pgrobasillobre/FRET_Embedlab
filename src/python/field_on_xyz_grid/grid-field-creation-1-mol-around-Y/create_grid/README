   Here, we expect one molecule (either donor or aceptor) on the top of the "cto_r30.xyz" 
   nanoparticle, along the Y axis, and we want to create a grid, going down the Y axis around it.

   For that, we use the geom.py code to create a sort of "vertical grid" to check the vertical
   spanning of the grid-points along the Y axis.

   $ cd 1_create_vertical_grid ./shift.sh

   Then, we create the grid points as:

   $ ./create_structures_full_grid.sh

   Which takes "cto_r30.xyz" and moves the vertical grid points stored in 
   1_create_vertical_grid/results_translate/*xyz 360ยบ around the structure
   (see "input_angle" for angle step) at a fixed ditance given in "input_translate"

   --> Results stored in grid/grid.xyz
